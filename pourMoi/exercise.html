                    <p>Self Love:<br><br>
                        One of my biggest hurdles. Not that I hate myself, I just cringe at the idea of "self love". I know it's
                        important but can't help but feel as though it is too narcissistic to play out.

                        Anyway, I'm trying to get past some insecurities, so sorry if this section is a little #cringe<br>
                        <br><br>
                        Insecurities and how to work through them:<br><br>
                        - Intelligence<br> Intelligence has many factors: academic, emotional, interpersonal, etc. It's not that
                        you don't have these traits, it's that you are not confident enough in them. Being confident isn't easy, so
                        take baby steps. <br><br>

                        - Looks<br> Looks are subjective, so just try to be your realistic best self. Find beauty in your differences.
                        Try to maintain routine and stay healthy, as this reflects on your looks the most. Drink water!
                        Eat consistently, sleep well, don't stress too much. Other than that, you can only hide your problems without
                        actually fixing them.<br><br>

                        - Body<br> It's hard not to fall into old, unhealthy habits. Remember, these are also band-aid solutions.
                        Starving yourself leads to your body overusing the calories that it does receive, meaning the weight
                        loss is unsustainable. Especially when you substitute real food for snacks. It also leads to a plethora
                        of other health issues! So instead, eat regularly and exercise. Your body needs the nutrients.<br><br>

                        - Comparisons<br> It's well known that negatively comparing yourself to others is harmful.
                        There will always be someone who you deem better than yourself. Although comparisons are inevitable, they can be
                        flipped in a positive light. Borrow the traits you like on others and try to apply them to yourself
                        in a way which is genuine to yourself. Do not try to copy them, as this is too inauthentic. Be happy
                        that there are people you can learn from around you, and be proud of them for achieving something
                        that you aspire to have. Humanize the other person and don't forget that they have insecurities of their own.<br> <br>

                        1. Humanize people you look up to.<br> 2. Learn from them.<br> 3. Apply what you can.<br> <br><br>
                    </p>

                    <p>Relationships:<br><br>
                        I always fall into trying to fix my relationships without fixing myself first. Any interpersonal
                        problems I have, I realized, are mostly to do with my own perception of myself and not the other person.<br><br>
                        1. Be more confident<br><br>
                        2. Don't be scared of people leaving<br><br>
                        3. Don't convince yourself that everyone leaves (including yourself)<br><br>
                        4. Don't make people guess what you want<br><br>
                        5. Give what you want to get<br><br>
                        6. Gifts are no longer gifts in you expect something in return<br>
